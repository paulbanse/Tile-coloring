      <b> Welcome to this study about scientific practices. We want to find out under which 
        circumstances scientific decisions are made.  </b>
      <br>
      <br><b> You will play the role of a scientist whose job it is to conduct studies. You can conduct as many studies as you like and test as many subjects as you like in each study.  </b>        
      <br>
      <br>
      In scientific work, these decisions have consequences: Investing more effort in a single study 
        increases the likelihood of a true and significant result (e.g. a difference between two groups 
        of participants or a correlation between skills). On the other hand, spending more effort on a 
        single study means that fewer resources are available for further studies with similar or 
        different questions.

        <b> Welcome to this study. We are interested in how quickly people click with their mouse and/or keyboard depending on different targets </b>
        <br>
        <br> <b> Feel free to score as many points as you can.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        On the next page, you will play a simple task in which you use the mouse to color in tiles. 
        Each time you successfully color in a tile, you will receive a point. 
        During this study we ask you at different stages to either:
        <ul>
          <li>color many tiles in one color</li>
          <li>use many different colors</li>
          <li>follow a certain rule on the number of tiles in each color</li>
        </ul> 
        
        Please carefully read what is required at each task.
        <br>

      In the next step we will show you how to proceed.
